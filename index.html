<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p> a) <code><strong>Lauren Arkell</strong>, Junior, Physics Major</code> <br>
b) I am taking this class because I am considering becoming a digital studies minor and I am intrigued by web design. <br>
c) I have no web-design experience. However, I have code/programing experience in a few different languages. I have taken a course that used R/R-studio and a course in python/jupyter notebooks at davidson. I also was exposed to HMTL in digital literature. <br>
d) My goals for this course are to familiarize myself with more coding languages and to understand the work done behind the scenes of websites.<br>
e) 1) <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix</a> <br>
One feature of <em>Netflix</em> that is interesting to me is that after you watch one show, there is an algorithm that spits out lists of shows you might like. Some of them even have a percent compatibility according to what you've already watched.
I also enjoy how you can hover your mouse over a movie or show cover and it plays a snapshot from that show to give you an insight on what its about.<br>

<p> 2) <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/">All Trails</a> <br>
The website, <em>All Trails</em> is a database for hikes across the country. I enjoy how they include everything from short walks to long hard hikes and that the hikes are ranked and can be searched by location.
While the website mostly depends on hiker reviews, there are enough users that the information seems accurate. I also enjoy how each hike webpage has the weather for that location, photos, reviews, a rating, and many other features.<br>
<blockquote cite="https://www.alltrails.com/">
"The beauty of nature doesnâ€™t need to be hard to find. Our goal is simple - build the largest collection of hand-curated trail guides, so you can explore the outdoors with confidence. Anytime. Anywhere."
</blockquote> </p>

<p> 3) <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a>  <br>
I love the design of the <em>National Geographic</em> website because unlike most sites, the background is mostly pictures that are overlaid with text. To me, this makes the links and words stand out much more.
The website also is home to a combination of articles, videos, photos, and many other things and they all seamlessly fit together on their main webpage. I might be biased towards this site because of how much I love the outdoors. <br>
