# Hello World!

<p> a) <h2 style="color:Tomato;">Lauren Arkell, Junior, Physics Major</h2> <br>
b) I am taking this class because I am considering becoming a digital studies minor and I am intrigued by web design. <br>
c) For web-design experience, I have minimally used Davidson domains in one prior course. For programming experience, I have taken a course that used R/R-studio and a course in python/jupyter notebooks. I also was exposed to HMTL in digital literature. <br>
d) My goals for this course are to familiarize myself with more code platforms and to understand the work done behind the scenes of websites. </p>
<p> e) 1) <code>Netflix</code>, https://www.netflix.com/browse <br>
One feature of Netflix that is interesting to me is that after you watch one show, there is an algorithm that spits out lists of shows you might like. Some of them even have a percent compatibility according to what you've already watched.
I also enjoy how you can hover your mouse over a movie or show cover and it plays a snapshot from that show to give you an insight on what its about.<br>

<p> 2) <code>All Trails</code>, https://www.alltrails.com/ <br>
This website is a database for hikes across the country from short to long and I enjoy how the hikes are ranked and can be searched by location.
While it depends on hiker reviews, I like the design of each page showing a single hike. Each page has the weather there, photos, reviews, a rating, and many other features.<br>

The beauty of nature doesn’t need to be hard to find. Our goal is simple - build the largest collection of hand-curated trail guides, so you can explore the outdoors with confidence. Anytime. Anywhere.

<p> 3)<code>National Geographic</code>, https://www.nationalgeographic.com/ <br>
I love the design of this website because unlike most sites, the background base color is black. To me, this makes the pictures and words stand out more.
There is also a combination of articles, videos, photos, and many other things and they all seamlessly fit together on their main webpage. </p>
